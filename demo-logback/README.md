# spring-boot-demo-logback

> This demo mainly demonstrates how to use logback to log the program's runtime process, and how to configure logback to generate both console logs and file logs. The file logs are split and generated based on date and size.

The setting of logback is in the `logback-spring.xml` file in the `resources` directory.
